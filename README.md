# Arduino-Home-automation-using-Bluetooth-and-IR-with-custom-application-using-MIT-app-inventor
Arduino Home automation using Bluetooth and IR with custom application using MIT app inventor, which work as a device control system which control the electical devices connected to the relay unit of the Arduino. Also the setup can monitor Temperature and Humiditu using DHT11 and it can sence heart rate using pulse sensor.
The setup works with both BT and IR where BT have a custome made app in MIT app inventor where IR have regular IR remote used for audio devices. The code for IR can be modifired to the code of the any IR remote. 
.aia file of the Android application is also added in the repo. which can be further modified based on requirement.
