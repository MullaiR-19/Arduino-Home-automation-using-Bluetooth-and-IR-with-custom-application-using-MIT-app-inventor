Arduino-based home automation system that uses both Bluetooth (BT) and Infrared (IR) communication to control electrical devices connected to the relay unit of the Arduino. The setup also includes sensors for monitoring temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor and sensing heart rate using a pulse sensor.

Key features of the setup:

1. Arduino-based home automation system: The system uses an Arduino board as the central controller to automate and control various electrical devices.

2. Bluetooth communication: The Arduino communicates with a custom-made Android application created using MIT App Inventor. This application allows users to control the connected devices remotely over Bluetooth.

3. Infrared communication: In addition to Bluetooth, the setup also supports Infrared communication. It can receive IR commands from a regular IR remote, commonly used for audio devices. The code for the IR communication can be modified to support different IR remotes as needed.

4. Relay unit: The Arduino is connected to a relay unit that allows it to control electrical devices, such as lights, fans, or any other appliances.

5. Sensor integration: The setup includes a DHT11 sensor for monitoring temperature and humidity levels in the surroundings. Additionally, it incorporates a pulse sensor to measure the user's heart rate.

6. MIT App Inventor: The custom Android application used for Bluetooth communication is developed using MIT App Inventor, allowing users to control the connected devices conveniently through their smartphones.

7. Flexibility and modification: The entire setup, including the Arduino code and the MIT App Inventor application (.aia file), is open for further modification based on specific requirements. Users can adapt the system to their needs by adjusting the code, adding more features, or integrating other sensors and actuators.

Overall, this home automation system provides a comprehensive solution for device control, environmental monitoring, and heart rate sensing, using both Bluetooth and Infrared technologies for communication, and it is designed to be user-friendly and customizable.
